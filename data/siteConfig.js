  authorDescription: `I describe myself as a proactive Software Engineer, someone who is 
  consistently growing and takes the time to keep learning every day.<br />
  I've been working remotely since I finished university in 2014, working for different companies
  from different places (United States, Australia, Spain, etc).<br />My strongest field is the 
  Frontend side, however, I also work
  in the backend, currently with Node. I have been working with React JS since 2014, 
  my main motivations are the 
  performance improvements, clean code, serverless tools, among others.`,
